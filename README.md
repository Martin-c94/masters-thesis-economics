## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains the full version of my thesis:  
**"Sudden Stop y Crisis de Deuda en Argentina"**, which examines the Argentine debt crisis of 2018â€“2019 in the context of capital flow reversals, investor expectations, and macroeconomic instability.

The study explores:
- How sudden stops affect vulnerable emerging economies.
- The interplay between fiscal fragility, monetary inconsistency, and capital market dynamics.
- The role of the IMF and external financing.
- Policy missteps and lessons for future crises.
